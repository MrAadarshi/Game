# 🚀 Payment System Setup Guide

## 📱 **UPI & QR Code Setup**

### **1. Update Payment Configuration**

Edit the file `src/config/paymentConfig.js` with your actual payment details:

```javascript
export const paymentConfig = {
  // UPI Payment Details
  upi: {
    upiId: 'your-actual-upi@bank', // Replace with your actual UPI ID
    qrCodeUrl: 'https://your-qr-code-url.com/qr.png', // Replace with your QR code image URL
    displayName: 'Your Name' // Replace with your display name
  },
  // ... rest of config
};
```

### **2. QR Code Setup**

#### **Option A: Upload QR Code Image**
1. Upload your QR code image to a hosting service (e.g., Imgur, Cloudinary)
2. Update `qrCodeUrl` in the config with the direct image URL
3. The system will automatically display your QR code

#### **Option B: Replace Placeholder**
1. Replace the placeholder emoji (📱) in `src/pages/Payment.js` around line 500
2. Replace with your actual QR code image:
```javascript
<img 
  src={paymentConfig.upi.qrCodeUrl} 
  alt="Payment QR Code"
  style={{ width: '200px', height: '200px' }}
/>
```

### **3. UPI ID Setup**
