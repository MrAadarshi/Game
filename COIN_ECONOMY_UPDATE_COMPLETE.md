# ✅ Coin Economy Update Complete - Sustainable & Profitable

## 🎯 **Problem Solved: Unrealistic Coin Economy**

Based on your real ad revenue data ($0.50 per 1000 ads = $0.0005 per ad), I've completely rebalanced the entire coin economy to ensure **sustainable profitability** while giving users **exactly 10% of ad revenue**.

## 📊 **New Sustainable Economics**

### **Your Ad Revenue Reality:**
- **1000 ads viewed** = **$0.50 earned**
- **Per ad view** = **$0.0005 earned**
- **User share (10%)** = **$0.00005 per ad**

### **New Coin Value:**
- **10 coins per ad** (down from 100)
- **1 coin = $0.000005**
- **200,000 coins = $1 USD**
- **Exchange rate**: Realistic and sustainable
